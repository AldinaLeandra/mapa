# Issue tracking

All tasks related to Platform development are stored as issues in the [Platform-API repository](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues). We currently use Zenhub for tracking where in the development process we are and for organising the issues.

* ​[Community tasks](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/labels/Community%20Task) in github are features that are up for grabs by community devs.
* Other tasks that we haven’t labeled yet may be suitable for work. Feel free to contact the team if you intend to work on something that grabs your attention.

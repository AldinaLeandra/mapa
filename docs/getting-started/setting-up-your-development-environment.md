# Setting up your development environment

## Platform API \(Backend\) Install Guides

### Installing with Vagrant

This is the preferred option for local development. The Ushahidi dev team uses this setup for most of their development work.

### Installing with XAMPP

This option is only recommended for local development, in particular for situations where it's not feasible or desirable to setup vagrant or docker. It has been tested and developed with the help of members of our community.
